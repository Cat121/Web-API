# This contains the mapping of biome ids to colors used in the map.
# Colors are specified as 6 digit hex codes (like in html/css).
# If a biome cannot be found then white ("000000") is used.
# If a biome contains "_mutated" in the id then the non-mutated version is used if a mutated version is not defined.
